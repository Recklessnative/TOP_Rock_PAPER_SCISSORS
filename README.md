Front end exercise from the Odin project

First project for TOP where I had to write and combine several functions to create a rock, paper, scissors game. 

A personal goal of mine was to have as little global scope as possible and to make sure all data was being returned and inputted in their respective functions. 
This was an excellent exercise on managing return values and input. I also worked with string methods to check and validate the input that the user provides. When the input is not what is expected, an alert is shown. This was a function I added myself. 

On the conditionals side, I was able to write out my logic pretty quickly. What helped me was to think in psuedocode and logic before typing out my function.

When debugging I was able to follow the flow the programs follows quite easily, discovering flaws and mistakes quickly!
